    "This notebook will guide you through the computations associated with our ro-vibrational experiment. Before\n",
    "starting the notebook, be sure to read through the background given in the lab handout. We are interested in computing a variety of spectroscopic constants, namely,\n",
    " - $\\tilde{\\nu}_e$, the equilibrium vibrational frequency\n",
    " - $B_e$,  the rotaional constant\n",
    " - $\\tilde{\\nu}_e\\chi_e$, anharmonic vibrational correction\n",
    " - $D_e$, the centrifugal distortion constant\n",
    " - $\\alpha_e$, the vibrational-rotational interaction constant\n",
    " - $k$, the force constant\n",
    " - $I_e$, the moment of inertia\n",
    " - $r_e$, the equilibrium bond length\n",
    " \n",
    "For many of these constants, we can compute them from a variety of known relations.\n",
    "For example, the rotational constant, which we'll get experimentally is related to the moment of inertia,\n",
    "$$ B_e = \\frac{h}{8\\pi^2cI_e}$$\n",
    "and the moment of intertial gives us a way to compute $r_e$,\n",
    "$$ I_e = \\mu r_e^2 $$\n",
    "where $\\mu$ is the reduced mass.\n",
    "Similarly, knowledge of $\\tilde{\\nu}_e$ allows us to compute the force constant, using the relation,\n",
    "$$\\tilde{\\nu}_e = \\frac{1}{2\\pi c}\\Big(\\frac{k}{\\mu}\\Big)^{1/2}$$.\n",
    " \n",
    "For $\\tilde{\\nu}_e$ and $\\tilde{\\nu}_e\\chi_e$, we can use their relation to the forbidden transition of the Q branch,\n",
    "$$\\tilde{\\nu}_0 = \\tilde{\\nu}_e - 2\\tilde{\\nu}_e\\chi_e$$\n",
    "which can be derived from equation 7 in the lab handout.\n",
    "As we will see, $\\tilde{\\nu}_0$ is obtained directly from the data. We can use this equation with\n",
    "$$D_e = \\frac{4B_e^3}{\\tilde{\\nu}_e^2}$$\n",
    "to obtain $\\tilde{\\nu}_e$.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the above equations, we now have a means of determining $\\tilde{\\nu}_e$, $\\tilde{\\nu}_e\\chi_e$, $k$, $I_e$, and $r_e$. How then do we get $B_e$, $D_e$, $\\alpha_e$, and $\\tilde{\\nu}_0$? If we combine equations 8 and 9 in the handout, and substitute the definition of $m$ also from the handout, we get,\n",
    "$$\\tilde{\\nu}(m) = \\tilde{\\nu}_0 + (2B_e - 2\\alpha_e)m - \\alpha_em^2-4D_em^3$$\n",
    "where $\\tilde{\\nu}(m)$ are our peak locations. So, from a list of $m$ values and $\\tilde{\\nu}(m)$ values, we can fit a polynomial equation to get each of the constants. We will do this using linear, quadratic, and cubic fits. First, I'll provide some data for the DCl molecule. Then, you will repeat the exercise using your data for HCl."
