    "Molecular orbitals are the basic building block of molecular modeling and quantum chemical computation. In this lab, you will compute the molecular orbitals for various molecules in order to gain an appreciation for how computational chemical models are used to help elucidate issues that often crop up in chemical research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular orbitals are composed of linear combinations of atomic orbitals. The atomic orbitals for those \"off the axis of symmetry\" are ofted treated as symmetry pairs. As a result, the orbitals for atoms not on the axis of symmetry are not treated independently. They come in various $+$ and $-$ combinations for small atoms. Can you think of why this is? Consider the particle-in-a-box wave function at higher $n$ values. The change in sign as the function crosses the axis creates a node. The addition of off-axis orbitals also creates nodes that must be considered since MOs are wave functions unto themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "For linear molecules, the computations don't actually create true $\\pi$ orbitals that encompass the entire exterior of the molecule. Due to some limits in the computation, these are treated as degenerate pairs (hence, two orbitals with the same energy) which have one iten in the on-linear and another in the off-linear Cartesian directions. If the linear molecule has the main axis of the molecule along the $z$-axis, for instance, the pair of degenerate $\\pi$ orbitals will be found in the $xz$ and $yz$ planes. This and other points should become clear in the below exercise. Remember to answer all questions in complete and correct sentences."
