Two energy levels are necessary to solve for $B$ and $D$ in Eq 4 since there are two unknowns. By plugging in the energy levels and rearranging the two equations, one may solve for the unique rotational constants of a given molecule. Often this is done with linear regression software, but this simple algorithm is robust enough to make the point.\n",
