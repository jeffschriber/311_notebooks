    "## Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to Physical Chemistry lab! Throughout the semester, we will be doing a variety of experimental and theoretical labs convering concepts in quantum mechanics, spectroscopy, thermodynamics, and kinetics. All of these will involve (potentially large) sets of data. One of the main goals of this course is to introduce you to a new way to manage your scientific data. Rather than using something like Excel, in 311 we will be using python! I like python because:\n",
    "- It is exstensible. What I mean is, we don't really need to do a whole lot of additional work ourselves if we work with a few values or 100 TB of data.\n",
    "- It is flexible. We can do so many things with python in a very customizable way, including statistics and data visualization.\n",
    "- It is fairly easy to work with. In my opinion, using python is as easy as doing anything in excel. One reason is that there are so many online resources, the most important being stackoverflow.com.\n",
    "- It is transferable. Data is in every field, and tools involving python are becoming more commonplace in a variety of industries.\n",
    "- Oh, and its completely free!\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry, you do not need any experience in python, though there is a (hopefully small) learning curve to get started. I find that using tools in python/jupyter notebook allows the computer to do more work, and the user (me) to focus more on the chemistry. The purpose of this notebook activity is to provide an introduction to using python and jupyter notebooks to do the kinds of tasks we will perform throughout the semester."

If you have questions, ask me, ask a friend, ask the internet, but please, try to work things out on your own first. To turn in this assignment, you will need to save the jupyter notebook (file type is .ipynb) and email it to me at jschriber@iona.edu by the start of lab next week.
